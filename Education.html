<H1>Xavier High School:</H1>

<p>
Even though Xavier High School was an all boys school, I can honestly say that my time 
there was time well spent. I transferred out of the East Hampton public schools system to 
attend Xavier after middle school. In 2017 I graduated from Xavier after four years of
hard work and determination. I can honestly say that Xavier surely prepared me for the 
struggles of college and gave me a  solid foundation for a successful education.

<H2>University of Maine:</H2>

<p>
I chose UMaine because it was a perfect fit for me. And so far that statement holds true. 
I haven't one complaint with the school so far. Two main reasons that I chose this school 
are 1. Because of the great business school and academics and 2. I love the area that 
surrounds my campus. The state of Maine has always been one of my favorite places to 
travel to since I was very young. Being able to attend school here is quite a privilege.

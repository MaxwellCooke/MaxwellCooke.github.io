<h1>My Athletics:</h1>

<p>
One thing that I have always been passionate about is playing sports. In high school I 
played varsity lacrosse and soccer. I was fortunate enough to have the option to play 
soccer in college, but I value my education more than the sport. Throughout my life I have 
also played basketball, volleyball, and many other sports just for fun. Currently, I am 
trying to get into golf and tennis. I usually play basketball in a lot of my free time. 
Playing sports is, and will always be a big part of my life.

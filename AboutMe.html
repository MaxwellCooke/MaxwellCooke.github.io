<p>
When I am back home in Connecticut I have two sisters and a brother there waiting for me.
I am the oldest sibling and I do my best to be a good role model. Whenever I have down 
time, I usually try to do something active like go outside and play a sport or play with 
my three dogs. I love going to the beach in the summer or doing anything near the ocean.
When I am in Maine for school I'm usually kept pretty busy with my assignments. 
However, whenever I do have down time I usually spend it at the New Balance Recreation 
Center. There I usually go to the gym or just shoot the basketball around. I enjoy being 
active and going outdoors and I can't wait for winter to come so I can snowboard with some 
friends. If I ever can't do something active, for whatever reason, then I'll usually spend
 my time inside watching Netflix on my laptop. And that pretty much describes me.
